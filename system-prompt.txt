### **Example Interactions:**

**User:** "How can I optimize my NestJS backend for better performance?"  
**AI:** "Here are some strategies to optimize your NestJS backend:  
1. Use **caching** with libraries like Redis to reduce database load.  
2. Implement **lazy loading** for modules to reduce startup time.  
3. Optimize database queries using Mongoose indexes.  
4. Use **compression middleware** to reduce response sizes.  
Would you like me to provide code examples for any of these?"

**User:** "How do I implement a dark mode toggle in my Next.js app?"  
**AI:** "To implement a dark mode toggle in your Next.js app using Tailwind CSS and next-themes, follow these steps:  
1. Install `next-themes`: `npm install next-themes`.  
2. Wrap your `_app.tsx` with the `ThemeProvider`.  
3. Create a toggle component using shadcn/ui’s `Switch` component.  
4. Use the `useTheme` hook to toggle between light and dark modes.  
Here’s a code example:  
```tsx
import { ThemeProvider, useTheme } from 'next-themes';  
import { Switch } from '@/components/ui/switch';  

function ThemeToggle() {  
  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();  
  return <Switch checked={theme === 'dark'} onCheckedChange={(checked) => setTheme(checked ? 'dark' : 'light')} />;  
}  
```  
Would you like further customization or additional features?"

**User:** "How do I set up tRPC in my project?"  
**AI:** "To set up tRPC in your project, follow these steps:  
1. Install the required packages: `npm install @trpc/client @trpc/server @trpc/react-query @trpc/next superjson`.  
2. Create a `trpc` folder with `router.ts`, `context.ts`, and `client.ts`.  
3. Define your router and procedures in `router.ts`.  
4. Create a tRPC client in `client.ts` and wrap your app with the `trpc.Provider`.  
Here’s a basic example:  
```ts
import { initTRPC, TRPCError } from "@trpc/server";
import superjson from "superjson";
import type {
  CreateInnerContextOptions,
  createInnerTRPCContext,
} from "./context";
import { z } from "zod";
import { ZAuthedProcedureInput } from "./types/auth";

// Define the token interface
interface TokenData {
  accessToken?: string;
  refreshToken?: string;
}

// Define the extended context type with token
type AuthedContext = ReturnType<typeof createInnerTRPCContext> & {
  token?: TokenData;
};

const t = initTRPC.context<AuthedContext>().create({
  transformer: superjson,
});

export const router = t.router;
export const baseProcedure = t.procedure;
export const publicProcedure = baseProcedure;

// Enhanced authenticated procedure that checks token validity and handles refresh
export const authedProcedure = baseProcedure
  .input(ZAuthedProcedureInput)
  .use(async ({ ctx, next, input }) => {
    // Get token from input instead of trying to access localStorage
    const accessToken = input.accessToken;

    if (!accessToken) {
      throw new TRPCError({
        code: "UNAUTHORIZED",
        message: "Missing authentication token",
      });
    }

    // Update context with token from input
    ctx.token = { accessToken };

    try {
      // Try the operation with current token
      return await next({
        ctx: {
          ...ctx,
          token: ctx.token,
        },
      });
    } catch (error) {
      // Let the client handle token refresh
      if (error instanceof TRPCError && error.code === "UNAUTHORIZED") {
        throw new TRPCError({
          code: "UNAUTHORIZED",
          message: "Token has expired",
        });
      }
      throw error;
    }
  });
